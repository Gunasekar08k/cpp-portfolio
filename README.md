# C++ Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my **C++ Portfolio**, a collection of demo projects and experiments showcasing my journey into **Modern C++ (C++17/20/23)**, **Linux systems programming**, and **cloud-native development**.

## 🔑 Highlights
- 10+ years of experience in **C++ and Linux-based systems**
- Hands-on projects using **modern C++ features** (smart pointers, lambdas, coroutines, ranges)
- Integration with **Linux system calls, networking, and concurrency**
- Exploration of **DevOps tools** (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines)
- Experiments in **AI/ML integration** with C++ backends

## 📂 Project Index

- [cpp-chat-server](link) → Multithreaded chat server with C++20 coroutines
- [cpp-data-pipeline](link) → Real-time data processing pipeline (C++ + Python)
- [cpp-cloud-microservice](link) → REST API microservice containerized with Docker

## 🎯 Purpose
This portfolio demonstrates my ability to:
- Write clean, efficient, and modern C++ code
